# qaAssignment

Please see attached QA_assignment.txt for all test cases and bug reports. 

Methodology:

I chose to store everything in a text file to avoid possible cross-platform formatting issues.   It's not pretty, but I wanted to focus on breadth/depth of test coverage.   All tests are manual with included shell commands to run.  I have not used much cURL in the past and am not very familiar with hashing libraries in Python, so in the interest of getting as much coverage as possible, I decided to forgo writing automated scripts.   I felt the vast majority of test cases were well suited for manual testing with the exception of a couple which could be verified using a simple loop bash command (included in test cases.)  

All assumptions/preconditions are listed at the top of the test report document
